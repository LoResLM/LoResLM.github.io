<!--## About LowResLM -- 2024-->
<!---->
<p>Neural language models have revolutionised natural language processing (NLP) and have provided state-of-the-art results for many tasks. However, their effectiveness is largely dependent on the pre-training resources. Therefore, language models (LMs) often struggle with low-resource languages in both training and evaluation. Recently, there has been a growing trend in developing and adopting LMs for low-resource languages. This workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work on LMs for low-resource languages. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>
      <p> Globally, there are approximately 7,000 spoken languages, yet most NLP research focuses only on about 20 languages with high resources1. The remaining numerous languages that receive little research attention are commonly known as low-resource languages. Even though these languages represent significant global communities, they generally lack sufficient digital data and resources to support NLP tasks or benefit from recent advancements in the field.</p>
      <p> Neural language models, particularly transformers and large language models (LLMs), have revolutionised NLP, achieving state-of-the-art results in many tasks. However, since the capabilities of language models (LMs) are also primarily determined by the characteristics of their pre-trained language corpora, disparities in language resources are evident within the models. Therefore, LMs often struggle with low-resource languages in training and evaluation despite their strong performance with high-resource languages.</p>
      <p>Following this bias in NLP approaches towards high-resource languages, which negatively affects a significant portion of the global community, there has been a growing trend in developing and adopting LMs for low-resource languages to promote linguistic fairness. To support and strengthen this movement, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work on LMs for low-resource languages. We mainly target to encourage the development of LM-based approaches and compile a research collection that supports ongoing and future research in this area, building on recent advancements in LMs.</p>
